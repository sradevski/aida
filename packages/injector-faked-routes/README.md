# **Injector** - Faked Routes

## Introduction

The **Faked Routes** injector generates a flat object with all defined endpoints, similar in structure to the **.endpoints.js** file, except that data models are replaced with mocked data.

## Dependencies

The **Faked Routes** injector depends on:
- [@aida/injector-routes](https://github.com/sradevski/aida/tree/master/packages/injector-routes)

## Use Cases

The main use case for this injector is to mock endpoints with fake data. For now, this injector is supposed to be used for request-response endpoints. There is no support for streaming, websockets, or GraphQL yet. Moreover, the only supported response content type is "application/json". The results from this injector can be used by the [@aida/consumer-faked-http](https://github.com/sradevski/aida/tree/master/packages/consumer-faked-http) consumer to mock APIs without making network calls to a backend.

## Example

``` javascript
// This is an example of how the data generated by this injector looks like. For more details on how to use this with the faked-http consumer, check the consumer documentation.
const fakedRoutes = {
 "/users": {
    "put": {
      "operationId": "updateUser",
      "request": {
        "body": {
          "id": "27bd418b-05e0-4e40-9fb2-54a9ff7de038",
          "email": "Katlynn_Upton@gmail.com",
          "phoneNumber": "914.750.8191 x2376",
          "firstName": "Bobby"
        }
      },
      "response": {
        "200": {
          "application/json": {
            "id": "27bd418b-05e0-4e40-9fb2-54a9ff7de038",

          }
        },
        "400": {
          "application/json": {
            "description": "Quod officiis voluptatem dicta provident est. Aliquid sint aperiam."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },

        }
      },
      "response": {
        "200": {
          "application/json": {
            "id": "27bd418b-05e0-4e40-9fb2-54a9ff7de038",
            "email": "Katlynn_Upton@gmail.com",
            "phoneNumber": "914.750.8191 x2376",
            "firstName": "Bobby"
          }
        }
      }
    }
