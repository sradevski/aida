# Aida - Unified data modeling

Aida provides a data and endpoint modeling structure. You can document your data models from different parts of the system in one place, while sharing commonalities between them. Aida allows you to unify how your data models and endpoints are defined, with all the necessary metadata being co-located. 

Once everything is defined and ready to be used, the possibilities are endless. You can mock your API on your client-side for trully independent frontend development, generate dummy data for your development database, generate API documentation for your backend, and generate validation and schemas, all done automatically. 

## Usage

You can find a **getting started** guide with installation and usage steps at [aida.github.io](https://aida.github.io).

## What Does "Aida" Mean?

The name "Aida" comes from the Japanese kanji **é–“**, which can mean "in-between", signifying something that sits between different parts of a system with the goal of enabling smoother integration between the parts.
