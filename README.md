# Aida - Unified data modeling

Aida provides a data and endpoint modeling structure. You can document your data models from different parts of the system in one place, while sharing commonalities between them. Aida allows you to unify how your data models and endpoints are defined, with all the necessary metadata being co-located. 

Once everything is defined and ready to be used, the possibilities are endless. Some of the use-cases for Aida are:

- Generate dummy data for your development database
- Generate API documentation for your API
- Generate schemas and validation for both your frontend and backend
- Generate types (Flow, TypeScript, etc.)
- Mock your API on the client-side for trully independent frontend development
- Fire mocked requests to your backend for testing
- ...


> Although the aim is for Aida to be language-independent, which is true for some of the things Aida can be used for, other things (such as validation) target JavaScript as of now.

## Usage

> Aida is currently in a very early beta, so there will be some breaking changes as the tool evolves. That being said, we will provide a proper changelog with upgrade steps as detailed and automated as possible.

You can find all the documentation about Aida at [Aida's website](https://sradevski.com/aida/). Please refer to the [**Getting Started**](https://sradevski.com/aida/docs/getting-started) section for an introduction to how you can start using Aida, or check the [**Reference**](https://sradevski.com/aida/docs/getting-started) section when you need a quick lookup.

## What Does "Aida" Mean?

The name "Aida" comes from the Japanese kanji **é–“**, which can mean "in-between" - signifying something that sits between different parts of a system, with the goal of enabling smoother integration between the parts.
