# Open API Docs

This is an example showing a sample OpenAPI/Swagger 3.0-compliant documentation config generated by Aida. In order to check out how the generated config would look like in openApi, access [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and copy-paste the content from **open-api** to their editor. 

If you make changes to the model, run `npm run aida` and then follow the same steps from above.
